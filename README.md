# Traffic-Net-Classification
The Traffic-Net dataset, containing 4,400 images across four classes (sparse traffic, dense traffic, accident, and fire), is ideal for tasks like object detection and image classification. Using deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of traffic scene analysis.
