# Traffic-Net Classification
## Introduction
Traffic-Net classification using deep learning involves categorizing traffic scenes into predefined classes to enhance traffic management and emergency response systems. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this approach aims to accurately classify images into one of the four classes: sparse traffic, dense traffic, accident, and fire.

# About Dataset
The Traffic-Net dataset, released in version 1.0, contains 4,400 images across four classes. This dataset is suitable for various computer vision tasks, including object detection, image classification, and segmentation. The images vary in size and resolution and were collected from different sources, such as Google Images, Bing Images, and Flickr. The dataset is divided into the following classes:

# Sparse traffic: 
Images of traffic signs and signals in low-traffic areas like rural roads and small towns.
# Dense traffic: 
Images of high-traffic areas, such as urban roads and highways.
# Accident: 
Images of traffic accidents, including damaged cars and emergency services.
# Fire: 
Images of fire-related incidents, such as burning vehicles and buildings.
# Models Implemented
## Sequential Model
### Description: 
A basic deep learning model where layers are added sequentially. It is suitable for straightforward architectures and quick prototyping.
## VGG-16
### Description: 
A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its depth (16 layers) and uniform architecture (3x3 convolution filters with stride 1 and padding). Effective for image classification tasks but can be resource-intensive.
## VGG-19
### Description: 
Similar to VGG-16 but deeper (19 layers), offering potentially better performance at the cost of increased computational complexity and memory usage.
# MobileNet
### Description: 
A lightweight CNN designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computations while maintaining accuracy.
